====

A basic QuickSort implementation that alphabetically orders lines of the standard input.

Compile simply using G++ :

$ g++ -o projet projet.cpp

Usage : 

We assume YourTextFile is a simple, UNIX-formatted text file.
In the program directory, type (without the quotes...) "cat YourTextFile | ./projet" in a terminal to get the YourTextFile file alphabetically ordered.
